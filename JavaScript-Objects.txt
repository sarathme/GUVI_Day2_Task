Objects in JavaScript

What is a JavaScript Object:
	“An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method”. This means that an object contains several key-value pairs where the key is used to access its respective value placed inside the objects. Objects are reference types where the assignment of an object to a variable reference the memory location of the object not the object itself.

Creation:

	An object in JavaScript can be created using curly braces {} which is known as object literals.

		var obj = { 
		    propertyName: value1,
		    2: value2;
		    “property name”: value3,
		} 

	As shown above the property name or the key could be a name or number or string literals. More over every data-type in JavaScript is an object like Array, function and primitive data types like Number, String.
    
	Since JavaScript has a prototype inheritance model where other programming languages like Java has class. This is one of the differences between Java and JavaScript. In JavaScript the Object protype is the top-level member of the tree and every object is connected to the Object prototype.

Accessing Properties:

	The properties of the object can be accessed using the property name (key) as by writing the name of the object followed by a dot or period (.) and the property name. There is also another syntax for accessing the property by using square brackets ([]) as object name and the property name is written inside the opening and closing square braces.

		Object_name.property_name; (for accessing and setting value)
		object_name[property_name]; (for accessing and setting value)
